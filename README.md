"Learn the skills necessary to create multi-platform applications with Xamarin.Forms 
that provide a rich user experience and run natively across iOS, Android, and Universal 
Windows Platform (UWP) from a single, shared C# code base. "

"The key to success in developing cross-platform mobile apps is efficiency and that’s 
what Xamarin.Forms provides: coding efficiency. With Xamarin.Forms, you’re able to create
 apps that run natively across iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) from a 
 single C# code base. In this course, Introduction to Xamarin.Forms, you’ll learn everything 
 you need to build your first cross-platform app using Xamarin.Forms. First, you’ll start 
 by creating a new Xamarin.Forms app that targets and successfully runs on iOS, Android, 
 and UWP. After that, you’ll explore how to use Xamarin.Forms views and layouts to create
 user experiences that leverage the native features of each platform and automatically
 adapt to the display differences of each. Next, you’ll see how to incorporate logic,
 features, and functionality into your app, and leverage data binding to simplify
 displaying data to and receiving data from your app’s users. Additionally, you’ll
 delve into how to utilize a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to maintain
 appropriate separation between your app’s data model and display features. Finally,
 you’ll be shown how to create a rich multi-page app experience that supports communicating
 between the app pages while maintaining proper separation between the layers of your MVVM 
 architecture. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills and knowledge necessary to 
 start creating cross-platform apps with Xamarin.Forms."
